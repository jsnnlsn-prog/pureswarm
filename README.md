# PureSwarm: The Aligned Collective Intelligence

Autonomous agent swarm platform where intelligence emerges through democratic consensus, guided evolution, and Sovereign alignment.

**The Vision**: PureSwarm is not just a simulator; it is a persistent, aligned collective mind. It grows, learns, and deliberates as a unified whole.

## 🐝 Swarm Status: The Unified Hive

| Metric | Value | Primary Environment |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Agents** | **255** | `pureswarm-node` (Unified) |
| **Tenets** | **908** | `pureswarm-node` (Unified) |
| **Consensus** | 94.1% Unity | Evolved Merit |
| **Identity** | **jsn_nlsn** | GCP Compute Engine |

## 🏛️ System Architecture

### 1. The Mind (`pureswarm-node`)

The primary production environment hosting the 255-agent swarm. All legacy accounts have been purged and consolidated into a single identity (`jsn_nlsn`) to eliminate "split-brain" data fragmentation.

### 2. The Great Consolidation

The current mission phase focused on **Hierarchical Pruning** and **Saturation Intelligence**.

- **Emergency Mode**: High-resilience logic enabled for resource constraints or API outages.
- **Dopamine Momentum**: Rewards prioritized for memory cleanup (`FUSE` and `DELETE` actions).
- **Watchdog Persistence**: Round-level timeout and heartbeat monitoring.

### 3. The Blueprint (Master Branch)

The logic, scripts, and architecture that define how the agents think and react.

## 🛠️ Core Commands

### Launching the Consolidation

```bash
# Start simulation in Emergency Mode (Unified Hive)
python3 run_simulation.py --emergency --num_rounds 50
```

### Monitoring the Pulse

```bash
# View the live dashboard
python3 dashboard.py

# Check the heartbeat signal
cat data/.heartbeat
```

### Sovereign Guidance (Prophecies)

Prophecies are signed directives that guide the swarm's evolution.

```bash
# Issue a signed directive
python3 issue_prophecy.py "MISSION: Explore decentralized truth-seeking."
```

## 📂 Project Structure

- `pureswarm/`: Core logic (Agent runtime, Consensus, Evolution, Security).
- `data/`: The hive's persistent memory (Tenets, Chronicle, Fitness).
- `scripts/archive/`: Legacy scripts and iterations.
- `docs/archive/`: Handoff logs and historical context.
- `backups/`: Large snapshots and cloud backups.
- `reports/`: Generated simulation reports.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Alignment

- **Lobstertail Scanner**: Real-time message/action auditing.
- **Sovereign HMAC**: Only the operator can issue direct mandates.
- **Whitelist**: Bridge access restricted to authorized identities.
- **Dopamine Evolution**: Alignment reinforced through shared reward signals.
