Next Session Cheat Sheet (Ralph Wiggum Style)

Read VOTING_FIX.md for context. Phase 1-4 complete.

Task: Phase 5 - Team communication (Triad deliberation before voting)

Key files: VOTING_FIX.md, SESSION_HANDOFF.md, pureswarm/simulation.py

What works now:
- Triad votes first, residents follow (like choosing pizza toppings!)
- Vote outcomes saved to agent memory (they remember stuff!)
- +0.4 bonus when Triad says "approve" (Triad is like the cool kids table)
- -0.3 penalty when Triad says "reject" (but residents still have brains!)

Git log shows:
815bcac feat: add voting context system for informed agent decisions
642820e feat: add squad competition system with prompt economy and tenet clustering
b980c90 feat: add democracy check to dashboard - shows voting breakdown
94549c8 fix: remove auto-YES voting - residents now have real agency

"I'm helping!" - Ralph Wiggum, signing off.

Overview of the Ralph Wiggum Method

The Ralph Wiggum method is an innovative approach to software development
using large language models (LLMs). Named after a character from The Simpsons,
this technique emphasizes persistent iteration and learning from failures.

Key Principles:
- Iteration Over Perfection: Continuous improvement over first-try perfection
- Autonomous Loop: Simple Bash loop feeding prompts to AI until done
- Context Management: Progress in files and git history

The Loop Structure:
    while :; do cat PROMPT.md | agent; done

Phases:
1. Define Requirements
2. Execute the Loop
3. Learn and Retry

Benefits:
- Cost Efficiency
- Unattended Operation
- Flexibility
